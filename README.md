# EditorFileMaker
Put into a unity project and this will add an item to the project window context menu to make it so that you can automatically make an editor file for the selected script, which will be placed in the root editor folder.

## How-To
The folder is a basic Assets folder, just drag and drop it into your projects assets folder.

## Current main problems:
* The Javascript template either isn't great, or doesn't work. I'm not a Javascript person, I tried.
* The templates have to be in the Editor folder in the root.
