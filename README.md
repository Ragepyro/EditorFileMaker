# EditorFileMaker
Put into a unity project and this will add an item to the context menu to make it so that you can automatically make an editor file for the selected script.

## How-To
The folder is a basic Asset folder, just drag and drop it into your asset folder.

## Current main problems:
The Javascript template either isn't great, or doesn't work. I'm not a Javascript person, I tried.
The templates have to be in the Editor folder in the root.
